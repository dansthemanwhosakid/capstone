    "With the saved Doc2Vec model, I will now create 3 interactive functions that will allow users to look for similar movie characters based on their preferences. `similar_characters()` receives a chosen character's id as input and returns the top 10 most similar characters based on their cosine similarities. Both `multi_filter()` and `quick_filter()` use `similar_characters()` in their functions. The `multi_filter()` function allows the user to look for a character by filtering through the genres, word count, sentiment, and movies. The `quick_filter()` returns a list of movies based on the user input and allows the user to search for the character in a much more streamlined process."

Don't respond to his taunting!  He's represented by counsel.  You want to speak to someone - you speak to me! Don't you put your hands on me, Detective. My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. What's happened is not his fault.  Emil was under the influence of his partner. At the trial, you'll see that my client will be vindicated... I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check. Oh, sure. How're they treating you, alright  I want to get the cuffs off... but there's a little bit of a problem. Things out there are very negative right now for us.  We gotta change that around.  Perception is very, very important.  Perception is reality.  I know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's important that I get that message out. Cause that's our only defense in this case. I want you to focus on three things: fear... ...delusions and paranoia. Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that. Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia. Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself. Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing. I would say...half.  Half is fair. But it's... This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me. I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here. Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like. Your mother was blind? Back in the Czech Republic? Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness? Your father put cigarettes out on you? Can I see your back? Oh, Jesus. I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. ...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill! ...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future. Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions. You may not like it marshal, but that's the law. Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!\""

      "The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are. Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must. With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her. May the Force be with you. Master Qui-Gon more to say have you? A vergence, you say? But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is. Trained as a Jedi, you request for him? Tested he will be. Good, good, young one. How feel you? Afraid are you? See through you, we can. Afraid to lose her..I think. Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you. Then continue, we will. ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon. Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth. An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second. Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready? Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has... And draw out the Queen's attacker. Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later. Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not! May the Force be with you. Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not. The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training. Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be. Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an apprentice.\n",

    "As you can see, natural language processing combined with neural networks can be pretty fun! The objective of the project is to allow a user to select movies and characters based on the quotes and dialogue of a different character. Perhaps there was a lasting impression of a particular movie character that a user wants to see again in a different setting. There are a few issues however. Though the data was acquired through two corporas, a few of the character lines are actually action and scene cues in a script. Non-quote and dialogue sentences may drastically affect the model's predictive abilities. Furthermore, a different statistical model, such as a Latent Dirichlet Allocation, can be used to explain why some documents are more similar to one another by allowing observations to be explained by unobserved groups. Perhaps a different recommendation system can be built with higher cosine similarities."
